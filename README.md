We are aiming to build a <b>healthcare promotion website</b>, which would make the "medical documents stacking" and "physician consulation" robust and freely accessible for anyone, anywhere. 

The <a href="index.html">index.html</a> file is the website's homepage. Also, these are the <a href="style.css">CSS</a> and <a href="script.js">JavaScript</a> files for the home page.

We have designed the <a href="loginindex.html">Login and signup</a> pages for the front-end and would soon be deploying the backend for its working. It has these as the <a href="loginstyle.css">CSS</a> and <a href="loginscript.js">JavaScript</a> files.

1. Document locker
2. Hospitals Locations
3. Robust consultation

5. Donation Option for Unprivileged
6. Medical test services
7. Diseases and their prevention documentation
